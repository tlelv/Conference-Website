This project was huge and took me about 6 months!

It helped me comprehensively learn about web-development and get a closer look of the front, back, and data that goes into Full-stack development.
It contains forums, tables, and designs to get accustomed to HTML and CSS.

The main outcomes from this project for me:

- Describe how platform-based web development differs from general purpose programming
- Design and implement a simple web application
- Prepare a relational schema from a conceptual model developed using the entity-relationship model
- Demonstrate use of the relational algebra operations from mathematical set theory (union, intersection, difference, and Cartesian product) and the relational algebra operations developed specifically for relational databases (select (restrict), project, join, and division).
- Use SQL to create tables and retrieve (SELECT), update, and delete information from a database.
- Describe common types of vulnerabilities and attacks in web applications, and defenses against them.
- Create and conduct a simple usability test for a web-based application.
- Describe the layered structure and function of a typical networked architecture.
